# Centerline data structures

## Project statement

We're developing a centerline file for use by the city. While we're gathering requirements internally from each department, we should look at how other cities manage this data. The scope of this data is broad and can encompass the entire right-of-way. Cities might publish:

- Centerline files (a polyline file describing the center of the road)
- Curbline files (a polygon file representing the paved surface of the road from curb-to-curb)
- Other types of files

Examples:
- Philadelphia publishes a curbline file: https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/curb-edges
- The US Census publishes the TIGER/LINE shapefiles: https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php
