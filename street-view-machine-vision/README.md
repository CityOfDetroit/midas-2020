# Street view machine vision

City of Detroit wishes to leverage its high-frequency collection of street-level panoramic imagery to extract 3D lines, polygons and volumes in geographic space which accurately represent real-world objects (streets, sidewalks, building facades, tree trunks, etc.)  This will enable the city to more quickly identify change, monitor non-traditional assets, and further develop spatial feature relationships and attribution for analytical purposes.

## Resources/Examples

All of our imagery is posted to Mapillary and can be accessed with an API key.
