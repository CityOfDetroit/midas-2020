# Base units assessment

## Project statement

We have several *base unit datasets*

  - Parcels 
  - Buildings
  - Centerline
  - Address points

Project: Develop an automated way to compare all these files for address misalignment. 

Many of these files are managed by different groups and departments at the city. As a result there tends to be different approaches to address structures, parcel history, unit numbers, and road names across the city. This makes it challenging to bring together geospatial datasets in a meaningful way without significant cleanup. 

Our priority this year is to develop better governed and managed base unit data files as well as an integrated data schema for all of them. We will make this available to the entire city as a centralized file. As we do this, it will be helpful to have an automated way to compare the separate files to identify areas needed for cleanup across the file. These base unit files are not static and will be regularly updated by the departments that steward them. In addition to creating a baseline assessment, when we receive major file updates, it would be useful to be able to use the same automated approach to ensure we have an understanding how much misalignment exists before a major updated to the central / integrated file.

We need to both understand misalignment to inform integration efforts, and be able to track base unit file improvement over time.
