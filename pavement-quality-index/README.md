# Pavement quality index

Develop pavement quality index of City of Detroit roads to foster data-driven operational and capital decision making. 
- Create image-based machine learning tool to ingest city imagery to provide insights on pavement similar to PASER scoring.
- Use existing datasets such as PASER ratings, other scoring criteria, pothole data, etc. 
- Utilize city collected imagery via Mapillary API

Develop prioritization index for road projects based on different factors (traffic volume, traffic safety, equity)
